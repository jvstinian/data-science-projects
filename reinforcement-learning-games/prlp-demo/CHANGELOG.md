# 1.1.0 

Adding a gym wrapper for the demo environment.

# 1.0.0 

This is the original version of the demo environment.  
While some changes might have been made by the 
contributors to this repo as outlined in the README,
this code should generally be in agreement with the code
found in the repo associated with the book _Python Reinforcement Learning Projects_.

Changes made by this repo's contributors to the original code include,
but are not limited to, setting up this environment as a python package and
adding a nix flake for reproducibility, building, a development environment, and
inclusion into downstream projects.
