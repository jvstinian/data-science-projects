# Adapted Python Reinforcement Learning Projects Demo Environment

This project is the pellet-eating demo environment from the code for the book _Python Reinforcement Learning Projects_.
It is intended to be used for reinforcement learning, and features an agent
that eats pellets, and is rewarded or penalized based on whether the pellet is nutritious or poisonous, which
is indicated by the color of the pellet.

We make some minor modifications to the code, mainly 
* adapting the code to be used as a python package, 
* any adjustments needed to support newer versions of python, and
* minor adjustments for our own experimentation.
